# Advent of Code 2020

## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual programming puzzle challenge organized by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/). From December 1 to December 25, a new puzzle is uploaded every day.

I'm following a self-imposed challenge to use a new programming language every day, for as long as possible. 

## Running the Code

To run the code from a particular day, check the README in that day's folder.

## Languages/Tools

* Day 1: [F#](https://fsharp.org/), a functional programming language from Microsoft
* Day 2: [Forth](https://forth-standard.org/), one of the oldest and most popular stack-based programming languages
* Day 3: [XSLT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT), an XML-based language specifically designed to transform XML
* Day 4: [A batch file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), run with the technically-Turing-complete cmd.exe
* Day 5: [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/), a natural-language-based domain specific language for writing interactive fiction
* Day 6: [x86-64 assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64), as low-level as I'm willing to get in a day
* Day 7: [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK), a text processing tool often used in shell scripts
* Day 8: [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL), a verbose old language designed for "business use"
* Day 9: [TCL](https://www.tcl.tk/about/language.html), a homoiconic scripting language where everything is a string
* Day 10: [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/), a successor to APL with the same concepts but using ASCII identifiers
* Day 11: [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), a lightweight prototype-based embeddable scripting language
* Day 12: [Factor](https://factorcode.org/), a stack-based language with types that supports functional programming
* Day 13: [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), a concise scripting language heavily inspired by shell scripts.
* Day 14: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), a low-level programming language meant to compete directly with C.
* Day 15: [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), a very user-friendly language inspired by Ruby, with static typing
* Day 16: [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/), the most popular and widely used logic programming language
* Day 17: [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/), an extremely efficient language useful for array-oriented programming
